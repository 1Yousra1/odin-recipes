        <li>5-6 cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp Minced Ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp Tumeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Garam Masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>1 pound Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>4 ounces Butter (cut into cubes)</li>
        <li>4 ounces Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp Garam Masala</li>
        <li>1/4-1/2 cup Chopped Cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, 
            EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, 
            mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. 
            If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better.
        </li>
        <li>
            Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure 
            naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cut-up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. 
            Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, 
            just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. 
            It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it.
        </li>
